# Silent Disengagement Detection

Early detection of silent student disengagement using behavioral patterns and explainable AI.

## Problem
Education systems often detect failure only after students drop out or fail exams.
Disengagement begins weeks earlier through subtle behavioral changes that go unnoticed.




## Solution
This project analyzes engagement timelines to detect early disengagement signals and generate explainable, human-centered intervention suggestions.

## Architecture Overview
- Event-based engagement data
- Rule-based, explainable disengagement detection
- AI-generated explanations using Gemini
- Designed for deployment on Google Cloud with Vertex AI

## Status
Core detection logic is complete.
Gemini integration is implemented and designed for cloud authentication.
